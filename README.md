# test-cypress-course

Launching cypress:

 Warning

Cypress could not verify that the server set as your baseUrl is running: http://localhost:8080

Because I didn't have my dockers up. Awesome!

Also automatically warns you about:

1. any JavaScript errors in the website
2. if a button or element is offscreen (e.g. you have to scroll to see it) - not sure how you set the viewport?

Debugging is amazing - but it still seems tricky to grab a value of a variable from the code and display it on screen...
